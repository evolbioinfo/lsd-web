<h2>Introduction</h2>

LSD-Web computes dates of internal nodes of a phylogeny and visualizes the results. To do so, it uses <a href="https://github.com/tothuhien/lsd-0.3beta">LSD</a>. Several scenario are possible, depending on the aim of the anlysis:

<ul>
  <li>Dating ancestral nodes;</li>
  <li>Computing confidence intervals on nodes;</li>
  <li>Rerooting the tree.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="glyphicons-how-to-use">Usage</h3>
<h3>Setting up analysis</h3>
Analyzes are launched on the <a href="{% url 'lsd:new_run' %}">run</a> page.
<ol>
  <li><b>Uploading input tree:</b> You should first upload the tree file in newick format on the section "Choose input tree file". LSD-Web will then analyze the tree and detect if it is rooted or not.
  </li>
  <li><b>Rerooting the tree:</b>  Two possibilities:
    <ul>
      <li>If it is rooted, LSD will propose to reroot the tree using an outgroup, to leave the tree as is, to reestimate the root around the given root, or to reestimate the root searching on all branches of the tree;</li>
      <li>If it is not rooted, LSD will propose to root it using an outgroup. If "no" is checked, then LSD will reestimate the root on the whole tree.</li>
    </ul>
    If you want to reroot the tree using an outgroup, a text field should be displayed that allows you to select the taxa belonging to the outgroup. If you select more than one taxon, LSD-Web will automatically add all the tips of the tree that descend from the common ancestor of all the selected taxa, in order to constitute a monophyletic outgroup. Once you select the first taxon, you may click on "more taxa" to grow the outgroup by going one step deeper in the tree, and taking all tips descending from here (if you select the whole tree as an outgroup, it will alert you that you can not reroot the tree that way).
</li>
  <li><b>Setting up dates:</b> If you know dates of individual nodes, you can select "I have a date file", otherwise you can select "I have no date file".
    <ul>
      <li>In the case where you have no date file, you can enter the date of the root and the date of the tips of the tree;</li>
      <li>In the case where you have a date file, you can upload it. The file should be formated as explained in the section "file formats".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Confidence intervals:</b> You can then choose if you want to compute confidence intervals for estimated dates or not. The confidence interval estimation is generally slower since it involves running several times LSD algorithm (basically 100 runs).</li>
  <li><b>Substitution rate:</b> You may enter the supposed substitution rate for the tree. If you leave it blank, LSD will estimate it.</li>
  <li><b>Sequence length: </b> Finally, you should adapt sequence length of the alignment that have been used to reconstruct the tree (1000 given by default).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Submit Job</h3>
<p>Once you click on submit, a new job is created and added in the computing queue, waiting for its execution. It may be in "pending" state until the server finished previous jobs.</p>

<h3>Results/Visualization</h3>
<p>As soon as the job has finished, the result page should be displayed with an interactive visualization panel displaying the result tree. This panel has three main options:
  <ul>
    <li>Mouse wheel: will expend/reduce vertically the tree;</li>
    <li>Click and move: will move the view up and down;</li>
    <li>Click on a node/tip: will select the node, and display informations about it.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

In the visualization panel, by clicking buttons in the "Export" section, one can download the tree in 2 formats:
  <ul>
    <li>nexus: Readable by different tree visualization softwares such as <a href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/">FigTree</a>;</li>
    <li>png: Image file of the whole tree (may have a very big height if the tree has many taxa).</li>
  </ul>


<h2>File formats</h2>
<h3>Tree formats</h3>

<p>Input tree files must be given in classical newick  format, with (or without) bootstrap supports, and with branch lengths.</p>

<p>Output tree files are given in nexus format, with specific comment data for estimated dates and confidence intervals. Each node is given a date field <code>[&date=2009.34]</code> and a confidence interval field <code>[&CI="2009.29(2008.99,2009.5)"]</code>.</p>

Here is an example of an output nexus file:
<pre>
#NEXUS
Begin trees;
tree 1 = (Thai63[&date=1963]:0.0372475,((((Thai84[&date=1984]:0.0110443,Thai78[&date=1978]:0.00554698)[&date=1971.95][&CI="1971.95(1967.68,1976.31)"]:0.0128306,SLanka78[&date=1978]:0.0183776)[&date=1957.94][&CI="1957.94(1951.57,1966.93)"]:0.0169442,((Philip64[&date=1964]:0.00325104,Philip84[&date=1984]:0.0215754)[&date=1960.45][&CI="1960.45(1959.03,1964)"]:0.00698343,Philip56[&date=1956]:0.00290475)[&date=1952.83][&CI="1952.83(1950.03,1956)"]:0.0122603)[&date=1939.45][&CI="1939.45(1933.42,1950.23)"]:0.00742674,(((((((((ElSal83[&date=1983]:0.0012483,Brazi82[&date=1982]:0.000332083):0,Mexico84[&date=1984]:0.00216452):0,NewCal84[&date=1984]:0.00216452)[&date=1981.64][&CI="1981.64(1980.09,1982)"]:0.000477342,ElSal94[&date=1994]:0.011804)[&date=1981.12][&CI="1981.12(1978.41,1982)"]:0.00186631,PRico86[&date=1986]:0.0063406)[&date=1979.08][&CI="1979.08(1976.64,1981.33)"]:0.00129706,Tahiti79[&date=1979]:0.00122415):0,Tahiti85[&date=1985]:0.00672144)[&date=1977.66][&CI="1977.66(1975.98,1979)"]:0.00314277,Indon77[&date=1977]:0.00253449):0,Indon76[&date=1976]:0.00161827)[&date=1974.23][&CI="1974.23(1972.62,1976)"]:0.0392979)[&date=1931.34][&CI="1931.34(1927.07,1948.33)"]:0.00824219)[&date=1922.35][&CI="1922.35(1922.35,1948.33)"];
End;
</pre>

<h3>Date format</h3>
<p>Dates (or temporal constraints) must be provided in a file having the following format:
  <ul>
    <li>Line 1: Number of lines in the file (number of dates)</li>
    <li>Other lines: 2 informations separated by a tabulation:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Node</li>
      <li>Date/Temporal constraint of the node</li>
    </ol>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Dates and nodes may be specified as follows. An internal node can be defined either by its label (given in the input tree) or by a subset of tips that have it as the most recent common ancestor (mrca). A temporal constraint can be a real, or a lower bound l(value), or an upper bound u(value), or an interval b(v1,v2). For example, if the input tree has 4 taxa a,b,c,d, and an internal node named in, then following is a possible date file:
  <pre style="width:40%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" >
  6
  a l(2003)
  b u(2007)
  c 2005
  d b(2001,2007)
  mrca(a,b,c,d) b(2000,2001)
  in l(2004)
  </pre>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Unrooted tree without outgroup</h3>
Let us take <a target="_blank" href="{% static "lsd/examples/unrooted_tree_without_outgroups/Dengue.phy_phyml_tree.txt" %}">this</a> tree in newick format, and <a target="_blank" href="{% static "lsd/examples/unrooted_tree_without_outgroups/Dengue.date" %}">this</a> date file.

The tree represents the phylogeny of the Dengue virus. It is unrooted, has no outgroup, and looks like this:
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="{% static "lsd/examples/unrooted_tree_without_outgroups/Dengue.png" %}"/></div>

The date file contains information on known dates of the tips of the tree:
<pre style="width:40%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
17
Brazi82 1982
ElSal83 1983
ElSal94 1994
Indon76 1976
Indon77 1977
Mexico84        1984
NewCal84        1984
Philip64        1964
Philip56        1956
Philip84        1984
PRico86 1986
SLanka78        1978
Tahiti79        1979
Tahiti85        1985
Thai63  1963
Thai78  1978
Thai84  1984
</pre>

<p>In this example, all tips have a date. It is worth noting that in some cases some species may have no date.</p>

<p>On the <a href="{% url 'lsd:new_run' %}">run</a> page, you can first upload the tree file on the section "Choose input tree file". LSD-Web will then analyze the tree, and detect that it is unrooted. It will propose to root it using an outgroup. In our specific case, we do not have any so we leave the radio button "No" selected (LSD will estimate the root on the whole tree).</p>

<p>Once the tree has been analyzed, you can specify if we have a date file or not. Here we have one, so you can select it.</p>

<p>Then, we can choose if we want to compute confidence intervals for estimated dates or not. The confidence interval estimation is generally slower since it involves running several times LSD algorithm (basically 100 runs). You can leave the checkbox checked.</p>

<p>You may enter the supposed substitution rate for the tree. If you leave it blank, LSD will estimate it.</p>

<p>Finally, you should adapt the length of the alignment that have been used to reconstruct the tree (1000 in our case).</p>

<p>Once you click on submit, a new job is created and added in the computing queue, waiting for its execution. It may be in "pending" state until the server finished previous jobs.</p>
  
<h3>Unrooted tree with outgroup</h3>
Let us take <a target="blank" href="{% static "lsd/examples/unrooted_tree_with_outgroups/h1n1_cleaned_original_phyml_tree.txt" %}">this</a> tree in newick format, and <a target="blank" href="{% static "lsd/examples/unrooted_tree_with_outgroups/h1n1_cleaned.date" %}">this</a> date file.

This tree represents the phylogeny of the H1N1 virus. It is unrooted, has an outgroup ("H1N2/Swine/hongkong"), and looks like this:
<div style="text-align:center;"><img style="width:70%;" src="{% static "lsd/examples/unrooted_tree_with_outgroups/h1n1.png" %}"/></div>

The date file contains information on known dates of the tips of the tree:

<p>Here we will follow the same steps as previously, with the exception of the rooting step. Once the tree is loaded, LSD-Web should tell that the tree is unrooted. Here you may click on "YES", to reroot the tree using an outgroup. A text field should be displayed, allowing you to select the taxa belonging to the outgroup (here we only select <code>H1N2/Swine/hongkong...</code>).</p>

<h3>Rooted tree</h3>
If the tree is rooted, LSD web will not have to estimate the position of the root. Let us take <a target="blank" href="{% static "lsd/examples/rooted_tree/h1n1_cleaned_original_phyml_tree_ingroup.txt" %}">this</a> tree in newick format, and <a target="blank" href="{% static "lsd/examples/rooted_tree/h1n1_cleaned.date" %}">this</a> date file.
